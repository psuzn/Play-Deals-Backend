Play deals is a simple app to aggregate the paid apps that have ongoing deals and discounts.

This repo contains the codebase for the backend for the actual app. It acts as a place to persist the deals and a
place to add,validate the deals. This backend is built using [Eclipse Vert.xâ„¢](https://vertx.io/) and heavily makes use
of kotlin coroutines.

## Development

./gradlew test
```
